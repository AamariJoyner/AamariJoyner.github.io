subtitle: African Diaspora Media Hub
project_title: "The African Diaspora Media Hub"

problem: |
  The African diaspora spans multiple continents and cultures, yet existing media platforms fail to unify its voices, histories, and cultural expressions comprehensively. This research proposal seeks to develop the African Diaspora Media Hub, a curated digital platform designed to aggregate and centralize news, podcasts, videos, and social media content related to the African Diaspora.

  This project will integrate AI/ML techniques to enhance content aggregation, personalization,and user engagement.

approach: |
  The project follows a four-phase pipeline:

  - Building & Development (technical contributions)
  - AI/ML Integration (Data Science & Analytics)
  - Content Curation & Research
  - Multimedia Production & Social Media Engagement
  Open-source tools such as Python will be used to prototype the system.

outcome: |
  TBD

  bio: |
    I’m currently a senior studying Accounting at Alabama A&M University in Huntsville, Alabama. I expect to graduate in 2025.

    My work explores the intersection of Financial analysis and reporting. Also explores other bases such as Audit& compliance checks in order to help businesses continue profiting even when their is a loss.

    When I’m not working on Accounting, Outdoor relaxation, Binge watching different series, and getting closer to God .

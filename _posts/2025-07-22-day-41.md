what_i_learned: |
    Today, we focused on refining our 90-second elevator pitch and making sure it clearly reflects the purpose and impact of our African Diaspora Media Hub. Through practicing and giving feedback, I learned how important it is to be concise while still making our message powerful and engaging. Our group also had some meaningful discussions that helped us connect on a deeper level and better understand each other's perspectives. These conversations strengthened our teamwork and brought new ideas to the table. Overall, today was about polishing our delivery and building stronger group synergy.

reflection: |
  Even though today was a lighter workday, it was still really impactful. Taking time to focus on our elevator pitch gave me more confidence in how I speak about the project and why it matters. The open dialogue we had within our group reminded me how much we've grown together. Everyone's ideas and energy made the space feel collaborative and inspiring. I left feeling proud of our progress and even more aligned with the mission we're carrying forward.

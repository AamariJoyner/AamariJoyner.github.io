what_i_learned: |
  Today, I learned the value of peer encouragement after we all took time to express how proud we were of each other following the mid-summer symposium. It reminded me how important collaboration and support are in a team setting. We also continued researching for the African Diaspora Media Hub, which helped me find new perspectives and resources to support our project goals. I gained a better understanding of how our research connects to the larger purpose of the hub. Additionally, we discussed the research paper, which gave me more clarity on how to structure it and make sure it aligns with the themes of our presentation.

reflection: |
  I really appreciated the chance to pause and recognize our progress as a group, it made me feel proud and more connected to everyone on the team. After the moment, diving back into the research felt more meaningful because we're all equally committed to the vision of this project. Discussing the research paper helped me see how everything we're doing ties together. I'm feeling motivated and inspired by the work we've done so far. I believe we're on track to create something impactful that will represent the African Diaspora with accuracy and care.

what_i_learned: |
   Today, Deke and I continued our research for the African Diaspora Media Hub, focusing specifically on films and articles that highlight cultural themes and shared experiences. I learned how to identify deeper connections between visual storytelling and real-world issues faced by communities across the diaspora. Our research helped us gather meaningful content that reflects both history and present-day narratives. It also gave me a better understanding how media can serve as a powerful tool for cultural preservation and education. This process is helping shape our media hub into a more informed and impactful platform.

reflection: |
   Working closely with Deke today showed me the value of consistent collaboration and shared curiosity. We were able to bounce ideas off each other and stay focused while discovering new material that really adds depth to our project. The more I research, the more I realize how important our work is in amplifying underrepresented voices. Every article and film we find brings us closer to telling a fuller story of the African diaspora. I'm feeling proud of our progress and excited to keep building.

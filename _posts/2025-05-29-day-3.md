what_i_learned: |
  Today was a very learning and intriguing day. I learned alot about Computer vison, which at first I had no idea of what it was but i now know that its a very cool tool. Computer vision teaches computers to see and understand the world like humans by analyzing and interpreting images and videos.After working on some examples I started to understand how YOLO works,how to upload a video or image, and also what the 4 major tasks are within computer vision. We also went into our breakout rooms and did a fun excape room. Though it was kinda hard we all were able to get through it!

reflection: |
  I really enjoyed my learning experience today. It was really exciting to draw closer in learning more about Python and how it correlates with Computer vision. Getting a chance to work with Mr. Andrew Kelly was very astouding due to his patience and willingness to teach. 
  Not only was this a learning experience but also we got to have some fun working within our project groups in order to excape an Excape room. This was very engaging and mind boggling, but it taught me a strong lesson about teamwork. After my lunch i went into my Python 101 class and learned more about coding and  type casting. We also went over the variable in Python, creating a digital profle with variables,the I/O cycle, and calculating wages.

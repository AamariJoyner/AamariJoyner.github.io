what_i_learned: |
  Today was a very good day, in which we first started off with two videos which focused on VSCode and how to upload it and then also on how to build a demo website. Though I struggled I was able to atleast get an insite on whats expected. I didn't know how a website could be built off of codes, but after seeing the video I learned that this is the more sufficient way to do so. 

  Lastly, we were graced with Dr.Kapanos arrival in which he got a deeper insite of our understanding of what the activity we were doing. I learned that he's not only passionate about teaching about the African Diaspora, but he's also passionate about our understanding. I am now eager to learn even more about the concept of computer programming and the various things it can do.

  Today was still very challenging due to me not knowing anything about the world of coding and computer programming, though we watched videos on the concept I believe in order to fully understand coding you have to start off at the beginning like any other study. Therefore I'm a little lost with what we are doing.

reflection: |
 Once Dr. Kapano arrived into the classroom, I realized that he's willing to help with my misunderstanding. I adore this because many in the program haven't wanted to help especially with me having a different major background than what is expected.

 I'm praying this experience allows me to draw closer with not only the great people I've connected with,but also with the concepts that we are learning. My Project on the African Diaspora is well understood, but the programming side still is fresh therefore I would like to continue to learn and strive to be the best that I can be.

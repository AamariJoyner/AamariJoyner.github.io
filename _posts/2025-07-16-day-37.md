what_i_learned: |
  Today continued with more research and steady progress on the African Diaspora Media Hub, but much of our time was also spent in conversation as a group. We had an open discussion about how we've been feeling throughout the program, and it became clear that many of us share the same concerns. I learned that shared experiences, even the difficult ones, can build stronger bonds among team members. We also reflected on how last miniute, unhelpful workshops and broken promises from admin have created fustration. It was an important reminder of how leadership and structure can deeply affect a team's motivation.

reflection: |
    Today reminded me of the power of unity and open dialogue. It was comforting to know that I wasn't alone in feeling disappointed with how we've been treated in this program. Being spoken to with disrespect and having our time overlooked by meaningless tasks can be draining. But even through that, our group is staying grounded and focused on what matters. I'm hopeful that our voices will be heard and that the work we're doing continues to reflect our resilience and purpose.

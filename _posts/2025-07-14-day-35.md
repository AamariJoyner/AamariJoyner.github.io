what_i_learned: |
    Today, we met with Dr. Kopano to discuss the next steps for our African Diaspora Media Hub project. He gave us helpful guidance on how to refine our approach and continue building a strong, purposeful platform. After the meeting, we continued our research, focusing specifically on African diaspora films and videos that reflect cultural identify, resilience, and global connections. I learned how visual media can express powerful narratives that written texts sometimes can't fully capture. This research continues to shape the direction and depth of our media hub.

reflection: |
     Talking with Dr. Kopano today reminded me of the importance of vision and structure in long-term projects. His insight helped clarify our path forward and motivated me to keep pushing for excellence. I enjoyed diving deeper into films and video content because it allowed me to see the diaspora experience through a creative lens. These stories are not just informative they're moving and meaningful. Each day, I feel more invested in the impact this project can have.

what_i_learned: |
  Today, we focused on preparing and practicing our PowerPoint presentation for the mid-summer symposium. I learned the value of collarboration as our team came together to support one another and refine our work. We also had the opportunity to meet with Jason from the Morgan States library, who gave a helpful presentation on how to find and evaluate credible sources. His tips helped strengthen our research approach and made our project even more reliable. This preparation gave me more confidence in both our content and our teamwork.

reflection: |
   Working with my team today showed me the power of unity and shared effort, especially during high-pressure moments. Everyone contributed and encouraged each other, which made a big difference. Meeting with Jason reminded me that credible research is just as important as creative ideas. His insight gave us tools to make our presentation stronger and more professional. I feel excited and ready to share our work at the symposium tomorrow.

what_i_learned: |
    Today, I was able to expand my understanding of the African Diaspora, as I do each time I dive into this project. I reviewed the layout we're building and noticed how the maps add powerful visual context to our research. We also had a discussion about the direction of the project and how we plan to move forward. This helped me see how all the pieces such as research, visuals, and structure which are coming together. It was a productive day of both learning and planning.

reflection: |
  I'm feeling very excited about what's ahead for our project. Seeing everything come together makes me feel proud and motivated. I believe we're on track to create something meaningful that can really impact educators and researchers. I'm hopeful that the information we're gathering will be shared in a way that's both accessible and powerful. Most of all, I'm looking forward to contributing even more as we move closer to the final product.

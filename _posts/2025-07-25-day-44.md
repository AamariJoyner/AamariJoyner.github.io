what_i_learned: |
    Today, we had the chance to hear from a guest speaker who works with drones and various machine learning tools, which was both fascinating and eye-opening. I learned more about how technology like AI and machine learning is being applied in real-world industries, from creative tools to advanced tech like drones. Afterward, we returned to our lab for a light project discussion, checking in our progress and next steps. We ended the day with a fun team bonding game focused on guessing R&B songs and artists. It was a nice balance of learning, collaboration, and connection.

reflection: |
    Hearing from someone actively working in tech reminded me of how broad and powerful these tools really are. It gave me ideas about how we could continue evolving our media hub with innovative thinking. The R&B  game was such a fun way to unwind and brought our group even closer together. We laughed, competed, and shared good energy. It's moments like these that make the hard work worth it. I'm grateful for days that feed both my curosity and my community.

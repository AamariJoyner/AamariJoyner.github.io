what_i_learned: |
  Today I learned more about countries within the African Diaspora, focusing on South Africa, Burkina Faso, Togo, and Cameroon. These nations are located in different regions of Africa, in which South Africa in the south, Burkina Faso and Togo in West Africa, and Cameroon in Central Africa. Each country has its own rich mix of languages, such as isiZulu and Afrikaans in South Africa, French and local dialects like Moore and Ewe in Burkina Faso and Togo, and both French and Enlish in Cameroon. I explored aspects of their history, musical traditions like South African house and Cameroonian makoosa, and foods such as jolluf rice, bobotie, and fufu. We also watched a video on how to build a website, which helped me understand the basics of web design and layout

reflection: |
   Learning about these countries within the African Diaspora helped me appreciate the diversity and richness of African cultures. I was especially surprised by how many different languages are spoken and how music and food play such important roles in daily life and identity. It made me realize how much history and tradition are preserved through storytelling, dance, and cuisine. This experience also reminded me how interconnected the African Diaspora is, even across different regions. Watching the website-building video made me think about how i can use digital tools to share what I've learned in a creative and meaningful way.

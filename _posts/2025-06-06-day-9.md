what_i_learned: |
  I learned today that the African Diaspora has multiple bases. We not only did alot of researching today, but we also came together in order to have discussions on our research. Something big that I learned today was how to offically utilize Chatgpt and Microsoft copliot, in which Dr. Kapano showed us how to ask the AI tools certain questions in order to get correct and sufficent answers. 
  
  Though we would still have to go back and check the information this helped get clearer and more broad answers. Getting deeper into discussion we learned about communities within the African Diasporas traditions,recipes, music, and many other cultural backgrounds for the communities such as, Gauna, Puerto Rico, Cuba, Panama,etc.

reflection: |
  I was graced with a very big understanding of how powerful the African Diaspora is. I now enjoy and love what this project will produce because not only will it speak to the Gen Z community, but also it could be known worldwide. I'm very grateful to be apart of this Project because the world needs this information and it could also grant me more connections that are important in the future. I'm excited about whats to come!

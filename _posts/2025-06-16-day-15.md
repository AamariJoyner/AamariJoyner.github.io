what_i_learned: |
    Today, I researched various countries within different regions and focused on their roles in the Transatlantic Slave trade. I learned that the trade followed a triangular route connecting Europe, Africa, and the Americas. Enslaved Africans were transported under horrific conditions during what is known as the Middle Passage. These individuals were then forced to work on plantations in the Americas, producing goods like sugar, tobacco, and cotton. This trade system greatly influenced the economies and histories of all regions involved.

reflection: |
  Learning about the TransAtlantic Slave Trade was eye-opening and emotional. It made me think deeply about the long-lasting effects of slavery and colonialism in today's world. I now understand how history still impacts social and economic systems in many countries.This research helped me appreciate the importance of knowing global history, not just local. It also reminded me that behind every fact or route, there were real human lives affected.

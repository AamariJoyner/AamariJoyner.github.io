what_i_learned: |
    Today I continued researching the African Diaspora and learned more about how Central America, the Caribbean, South America, and North America have been shaped by African influence. I discovered that many countries across these regions share similiar cultural traditions such as food, music, religion, language, and community values, which all have deep African roots.

    I noticed how African descended people in these areas preserved their identities and adapted their cultures despite colonization and oppression. We also got to meet our high school teacher, Mr.Groves, and did an icebreaker activity to get to know him better. It was a great way to end a powerful learning experience.

reflection: |
      Meeting Mr. Groves and doing the icebreaker helped me feel more connected and excited about the class moving forward. Reflecting on my research today, I'm amazed by how similar the cultures of African descended communities are across different continents. It's powerful to see how people carried their traditions through music, food, faith, and resistance, even when they were taken from their homeland.

      I feel proud and inspired by the unity and strength within the African diaspora. This experience reminded me that we are all part of a global story of resilence, creativity, and legacy.

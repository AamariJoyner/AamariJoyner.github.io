what_i_learned: |
  Today was a little busy than it was the other days in which we learned more about coding and was introduced to what visualization was. Visualization in coding refers to creating visual representations of code, its structure, behavior, and execution, often to help programmers understand and debug complex systems.

  When learning what visualization was we began watching a youtube video about Python Sentimen, while watching this video we were also working in Google Collab doing the examples and then after we were given an assignment to build a dataset based on our project and apply what we learned in the video to our Google Collab.

  Today was a little challenging due to us going more in dept about coding and then being introduced to Visualization using dataset. Because I am not an CS major this is very new to me therefore I've struggled, but I'm excited to try an understand it in order to be able to conduct our African Diaspora project.

reflection: |
 Today was very challenging with learning coding due to it being a new learning process. Though in the first virtual week Mr. Clyde went over some Python information to a new learner its very hard to catch on to. Doing this Project on the African Diaspora is something big to me though because its focusing on all aspects of the African continent after the slave trade. Getting to learn new things is exciting to me, although its a bit challenging I'll soon understand it and grow from this experience.

what_i_learned: |
  Today, I learned more about the African diaspora and its global impact. Through my research, I discovered how deeply connected African cultures are to different parts of the world due to migration and history. I also learned how to organize information in a clear and engaging way. We worked on designing the front page of our media hub, focusing on layout and visuals. This helped me understand the importance fo presentation in media.

reflection: |
  Researching the African diaspora opened my eyes to how African culture has shaped societies worldwide. It made me realize how much history influences today's culture. Working on the front page layout also reminded me that how we present stories can affect how people connect with them. I enjoyed combining creativity with research. Overall, today helped me grow both as a learner and a designer.

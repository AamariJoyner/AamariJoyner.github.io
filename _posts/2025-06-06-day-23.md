what_i_learned: |
  Today I focused on preparing for our symposium presentation by researching additional references to support our identified gap. The African Media Hub fills a crucial need in both media and academic spaces by creating a centralized, community-led platform that highlights contents by and for the African Diaspora. I learned that Black media is often scattered, underrepresented, or misinterpreted in mainstream spaces, which makes this project especially meaningful. The sources I found helped reinforce why our work matters and how it can be a powerful tool for visibility, education, and empowerment. This research helped me better understand the importance of organizing and elevation Black narratives on a global scale.

reflection: |
   Working on the symposium presentation today reminded me how powerful and necessary our project really is. The gap we identified is not just academic but it's personal, cultural, and historical. Seeing how overlooked Black media can be made me even more committed to this work. I'm proud to be part of something that aims to uplift and unify the African Diaspora through storytelling and accessible knowledge. This experience is teaching me that research has a purpose when it's rooted in community and truth.

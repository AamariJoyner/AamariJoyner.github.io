what_i_learned: |
      Despite facing delays and challenging start of the day, I was able to stay focused and continue researching content for the African Diaspora Media Hub. I gathered more information to help strengthen our platform and give it deeper cultural context. I also learned that even in difficult circumstances, staying committed to the work can still lead to progress. Frustrations within the program were expressed, especially around how admin communication has affected team morale. These conversations showed me how important it is to have a supportive environment when doing meaningful work.

    No blockers.

reflection: |
  Yesterday was a tough day emotionally and physically, but I'm proud that I still pushed through and contributed to our project. The delays and negative energy from administration made it harder to stay motivated, but talking with my peers reminded me that we're all in this together. It's disappointing when leadership speaks down to students, especially when we've been working hard. Still, our passion for this project keeps us going. I'm hopeful that we'll continue to rise above the negativity and let our work speak for itself.

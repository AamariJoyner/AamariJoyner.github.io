what_i_learned: |
    Today I deepened my research on the African Diaspora by studying articles that focused on pre-colonial times, the period of slavery, and the post-slavery era across different regions. I gained a better understanding of how  African societies functioned before colonization and how those systems were disrupted but never fully erased.
    The articles also revealed how communities rebuilt and preserved culture through resistance, adaptation, and legacy. I also explored how these historical periods affected the identity, traditions, and struggles of African-descended people around the world. Our discussion with Dr. Kopano gave me a new perspective on how far this project could reach and the real impact it can have.

reflection: |
    Talking to Dr. Kopano today made me feel inspired and motivated about the purpose behind our work. It reminded me that this project isn't just for a grade but it's about telling the truth, honoring legacy, and building bridges through knowledge. The research helped me connect the past with the present and recognize the patterns of resilience and power in African-descended communities. 
    I feel like I'm uncovering something bigger than I imagined, and it makes me want to keep learning and sharing. This experience has taught me the value of storytelling, research, and cultural preservation on a global level.

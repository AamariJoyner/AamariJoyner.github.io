what_i_learned: |
     Today was all about preparation as we focused on finalizing our presentation for the upcoming symposium. I learned how to structure key points to make our message clear, engaging, and impactful for our audience. We also spent some time working on our research paper, making sure our sources and analysis align with the goals of the project. It was a productive day of refining and strengthening our final deliverables. Each part of the process reminded me of the importance of clarity, organization, and teamwork.

reflection: |
     As we get closer to the end of the program, it feels good to see everything coming together. Working on the symposium presentation made me reflect on how much we’ve learned and how far we’ve come as a group. It’s exciting to polish our work and prepare to share it with others. Even though we’re in the final stretch, I’m still learning and growing through the process. Today reminded me that finishing strong is just as important as how we started.

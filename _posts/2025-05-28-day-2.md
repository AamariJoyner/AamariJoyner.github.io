what_i_learned: |
  I started learning the basics of Python and what print means. Using Python I was also able to learn what strings are and how they coincide with print. Today was a big day of learning because I also learned about the Advanced operaters. Basic operaters,and the Numbers in Python.

  We also did Kahoots in order to make sure that the concept was not learned but also well understood.

  No blockers

reflection: |
  I was able to fully learn what the program Python was. It was very intriguing to learn how proficient and helpful the tool was while working in our breakout rooms. I cant wait to continue learning more about the functions this great and simple tool does.

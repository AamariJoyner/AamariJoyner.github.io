what_i_learned: |
    Today was a more relaxed and steady day, giving us time to focus on finalizing our 90-second elevator pitch. I learned how to fine-tune our language to make the message clear, impactful, and easty to understand in a short amount of time. We worked on bringing all of our ideas together and making sure everything flowed smoothly. This process showed me how important it is to be intentional with every word when time is limited. It also gave us the space to polish our delivery and unify our voice as a team.

    No blockers.

reflection: |
    Having a slower-paced day was much needed and gave us a chance to breathe while still staying productive. It felt good to see all of our pieces coming together as we near the final stretch of the project. Collaborating on the pitch reminded me how far we've come and how strong we are as a team. I'm proud of the work we've put in and how we're learning to present it with confidence. Today was a reminder that progress doesn't always have to feel rushed,but it can also be steady and meaningful.

what_i_learned: |
  Today, I learned the importance of team bonding in building stronger group dynamics. Playing Taboo and Jenga allowed me to see different sides of my peers, especially how they communicate and compete. It was refreshing to interact in a fun, non-wor setting and reminded me how valuable these moments are. I also learned more about my group's responsibilities for the African Diaspora Media Hub. Seeing our current layout helped clarify what we've accomplished and what's expected moving forward.

reflection: |
  I really appreciated today's team bonding activity it gave us a rare chance to connect beyond our usual work setting. It reminded me of how important community is, especially in collaborative projects. Expressing our ideas for Thursday gatherings showed our shared commitment to staying connected. Going back into the lab felt more energized because of that positive interaction. I'm looking forward to continuing work on the media hub with a stronger sense of unity and direction.

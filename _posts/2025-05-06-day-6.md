what_i_learned: |
  Today we learned more about our Project and whats expected. We also watched a video on Coding and worked in our Google Collab on the examples that were given. 
  After learning the concept we went into an activity where we named 3 countries and their traditions, putting into one data set and uploading it into our Google collab in order to make a visualization out of it .

blockers: |
    Today I had some trouble with understanding how to fully visualize my data set although we went over it in a video I'm still trying to fully understand the concept.

reflection: |
  Though today was a little challenging, I'm learning more about coding and how to apply it! The more I continue to learn the concept the better I'll be able to understand it.

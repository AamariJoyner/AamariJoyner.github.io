what_i_learned: |
  Today,we attended a writing center meeting where an instructor walked us through the key elements of writing a research paper. I learned the important dos and dont's, such as avoiding vague language, staying focused on the thesis, and properly citing sources. Afterward, we returned to the lab to continue working on our project and gathering more research. During that time, my group and I took a moment to have a "girls talk" session to get to know one another better. It was a refreshing balance of productivity and bonding.

reflection: |
  Today reminded me that learning happens in and outside of the classroom. The writing session gave me helpful tools to improve my academic writing, which I know will strengthen our project. Taking time to connect with my team on a personal level also meant a lot, we were able to laugh,share, and build trust. That bond made our working environment feel even more supportive. I'm grateful for moments like this that blend growth, connection, and collaboration.

what_i_learned: |
  Today was very nice and exciting day. The first half of our day we not only went through orientation and learned about how to form a sufficient research question,but also what the dependent and independent variables would be. After engaging with our mentor I was able learn more about my Project group, in which we were able to work together with building the tallest tower using noodles,tap, and a marshmellow. This activity was not only fun and engaging,but it helped me to see how our group could come togehter in order to complete a task.

  Going into the lab with my project group was also exciting due to us learning more about the African Diaspora. Dr. Kapano was able to explain to us why this project is super important n which after going over the slave trade and how it coincides with today I was able to understand the concept better. At the last quarter of the day my graduate mentor explained to us what overfeeding means on the technical side and instruced us to submit an example of what we think the front side of our website should look like.

 I'm very excited about getting started on this great project due to the overall bases of it. In which we are making a website for not only teaching purposes but for learning purpsoes also. Therefore anyone in an educational field or seeking to learn more about the African Diaspora they are able to come to our website and actually understand therefore the importance is spread nationwide.

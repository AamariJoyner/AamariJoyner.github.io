   Today, after finalizing our 90-second elevator pitch, we had the opportunity to meet with Mr. Adisa Bakari over Zoom. He shared valuable insight on how we can take our media hub to the next level and make it globally accessible and impactful. I learned about the importance of strategic storytelling, branding, and making sure our platform can resonate with people from all walks of life. His advice helped me see the bigger picture and understand what it truly takes to expand our project beyond the classroom. It was an inspiring moment that added depth and direction to our work.

  Meeting with Mr. Bakari gave me a renewed sense of motivation and vision for what our media hub can become. It reminded me that what we’re creating isn’t just for a grade—it has the potential to reach and connect with people around the world. Finalizing our elevator pitch and getting expert feedback made me feel more confident in our message and the power behind it. I’m proud of how far we’ve come as a team, and I’m excited about the future possibilities. Today was a turning point that reminded me of the real-world impact of our work.

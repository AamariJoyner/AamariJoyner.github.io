what_i_learned: |
  I learned what Git & GitHub was, and also took on a role of building my own website. I didn't understand what repositories were and how these tools are used but I'm slowly understanding.

    I had a problem with building my own website but i was able to learn and figure it out .

reflection: |
  It was great learning about Git and GitHub. It was exciting learning something new because I've never heard of this these types of tools.Therefore its exciting getting to know a new thing.

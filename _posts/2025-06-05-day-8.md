what_i_learned: |
  Today was a very exhausting day honestly. We first started the day off with a tour around campus, in which we were able to see the student center, football field, Engineering building, and other important buildings located on Morgan States campus. Though it was very hot it was kinda interesting to learn about what actually goes on in the buildings. What stood out to me the most was the Health and Human Services Center also known as the HHSC building. It was very intriguing to here how they study not only brain of a human but all aspects and have labs where they test out many theories.

  Once we got back to our labs after our tour we went into a discussion more about our Project. Making sure we have a significant game plan for forming our website and presentations are crucial. Therefore we did more research into the African Diaspora.

  Today was very relaxing after our tour. The heat was very much draining walking everywhere, but it was neat to learn about all that Morgan State offers. As always its a great day to learn more about the African Diaspora due to this project being the best one offered during this program. There is always something knew you can learn from just this one topic, and to have the opportunity to not only do research on it but to make a website where anyone willing to learn is able to access this information is mind blowing.

what_i_learned: |
  Today, I did some research for the Brief literature overview of our presentation. I revisted our central idea, which is that the African Media Hub fills a major gap in both media and academic spaces by creating a unified platform for African Diaspora content. This helped reinforce my understanding of the importance of our work and the need for a space that centers Black voices.

  I was also introduced to a new AI tool call Latimer, which is designed to support research and content creation focused on Black communities. Using it, I was able to find credible sources that directly support the gap we identified in our overview.

    No blockers.

reflection: |
   I'm glad I took time to go deeper into the literature because it reminded me why this project matters. The African Diaspora has such a rich and diverse history, but it's often underrepresented in mainstream spaces. Seeing tools like Latimer being developed made me feel hopeful about the future of Black-centered technology and storytelling. It also made me realize how important it is to keep exploring new tools that align with our mission. I'm proud of the progress we're making and excited to keep building something that educators and researchers can truly benefit from.

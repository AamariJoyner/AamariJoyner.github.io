what_i_learned: |
  Today was a very challenging day but it was also a good day! We first started with our Python 101 class in which I learned more about coding and the 3 logical operators in Python. We also learned about a new data type Boolean and did some kahoots on it. After going back into the main room we also went over the intro the Generative AI and LLMS. I learned exactly what Articial Intellingence was and how the goal is to mimic intelligence using rules and logic. Also Machine Learnings goal is to learn from data to make predictions without explicit programming.We also went over Deep Learning,Tokenization and Embeddings.

  We did a project at the end of the Python 101 class and it was to use the codes we went over and I became confused due to lack of knowledge. Im still a beginner so I didnt fully grasp the concept.

reflection: |
  These passed days on zoom have been very intriguing and full of knowledge. Im super excited about joining in person, especially with how patient some of the intructors were. Todays presentation with Clyde about Generative AI and LLMS was very knowledgable and I learned alot about what Articial Intelligence and Machine learning really is and how important it really is . I didnt know AI has been studied for years so that was very interesting.

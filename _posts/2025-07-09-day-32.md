what_i_learned: |
    Today, we spent time discussing our upcoming research paper and continued exploring more content for the media hub. I collaborated with Deke to analyze the connections between different films from the countries we're focusing on, which deepened my understanding of shared narratives across cultures. We also had the opportunity to speak with Olu Kopano, who offered valuable insight on how food, music, and culture can serve as bridges across the African Diaspora. His perspective helped me see the importance of highlighting what unites us globally. This added a meaningful layer to how we approach our project content moving forward.

reflection: |
   Collaborating with Deke reminded me how powerful teamwork can be when researching meaningful topics. Our conversation with Olu Kopano inspired me to think more intentionally about cultural connections and the universal themes we often overlook. I'm learning that our media hub isn't just about representing the diaspora it's about building unity through shared experiences. Today made me even more excited about the direction we're going. It felt good to see how our work can connect people from all over the world.

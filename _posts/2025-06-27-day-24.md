what_i_learned: |
   This week, I made major progress on our presentation,completing most of the slides and adding strong research and credible sources about the identified gap in the African diaspora. I learned how to sharpen our message for an academic audience and structure our content clearly for the mid-summer symposium. We also had the incredible opportunity to pitch our project to top leaders at Morgan State, including the VP,President, and several deans. Their positive feedback showed me how powerful and needed our project is. It was a real lesson in how preparation, purpose, and teamwork can open doors.

reflection: |
   Meeting with the leadership at Morgan State was a powerful moment. I realized our work is not only being seen, but its being valued. Hearing that they want to see more reminded me that we're building something important and impactful. I'm deeply proud of my team; when it mattered most, we supported each other and showed up with confidence. This experience made me believe even more in our media hub and what it represents. It was a big step forward, and I feel both humbled and motivated.

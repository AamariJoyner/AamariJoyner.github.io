what_i_learned: |
   Today, I learned how to analyze maps and news articles related to the African Diaspora more effectively. I practiced checking sources for credibility by looking at the author, publication, and date. This helped me understand which sources I could trust and which ones might be biased or outdated. I also learned more about the migration patterns of African people across the world and how they shaped different cultures. OVerall, I gained a clearer picture of how the African Diaspora continues to influence society today.

reflection: |
   This research made me more aware of how important it is to be intentional when choosing sources. I used to just pick articles that looked interesting, but now I know to look deeper into who created them and why.
   I also feel like I understand the African Diaspora on a more personal level, not just as a topic, but as a global experience that connects people. It was rewarding to see how much progress I've made in being able to break down complex information. I'm excited to keep building on what I've learned and dig even deeper into this topic.

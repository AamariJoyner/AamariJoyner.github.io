what_i_learned: |
    Today, we completed the final presentation slides for our upcoming Final Symposium, making sure every detail was clear, cohesive, and impactful. I learned how to organize key points visually and verbally in a way that communicates our project’s message effectively to a professional audience. Working through the final edits reminded me of how much thought and effort has gone into this project from start to finish. It also showed me how important collaboration and clear communication are in preparing for a formal presentation. Reaching this milestone made me appreciate the process even more.

reflection: |
   Finishing our presentation slides for the Final Symposium felt like a big accomplishment. It was a moment to step back and really see all the work we’ve done come together in a meaningful way. I’m proud of how our team stayed focused and worked together to create something we can stand behind. Now that the slides are done, I feel confident and excited to share our work and represent our team well. This experience has truly prepared us for moments like this.

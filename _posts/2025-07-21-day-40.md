what_i_learned: |
    Today, we spent time in the auditorium learning how to use Overleaf, a collaboritive writing tool that will help us format and organize our research paper more professionally. I learned how to navigate the platform and better understand how it can streamline the writing process, especially when working in teams. After the workshop, we returned to the lab and had a productive discussion about our upcoming 90-second elevator pitch. We brainstormed how to clearly and effectively present the purpose and impact of our media hub. The day helped us sharpen both writing and our communication strategies.

reflection: |
  Learning how to use Overleaf was new for me , but I can see how helpful it will be in making our research paper look polished and well-organized. It was also great to regroup with my team and map out ideas for our elevator pitch, we're all starting to understand how to speak confidently and concisely about our project. These smaller presentations are building our skills for larger opportunities. Even though it was alot of information, I'm glad we're being pushed to grow in different areas. It's clear that everythign we're learning now will prepare us for future academic and professional spaces.

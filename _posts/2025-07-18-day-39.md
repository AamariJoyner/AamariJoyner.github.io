what_i_learned: |
    Today was a major step forward as we had the opportunity to meet with the dean and present our African Diaspora Media Hub project. I learned how to confidently communicate our vision and explain the purpose behind our work to someone in leadership. The experience also taught me how important it is to stay prepared and professional, especially when presenting to key decision-makers. The dean's feedback helped me see the potential impact of our project beyond just the classroom. It was a valuable moment that showed how far we've come.

    No blockers.

reflection: |
    Presenting to the dean today made me feel proud of everything my team and I built so far. It was a reminder that our work has meaning and is being recognized by those in positions of influence. Being able to share our vision and recieve encouragement was uplifting, especially after the challenges we've faced. I left the meeting feeling more confident in our direction and motivated to keep pushing forward. This was a moment of validation that we truly needed.

what_i_learned: |
  I learned that HTML is the backbone of a webpage, providing structure through elements like headings, paragraphs, links, and images. CSS, on the other hand, is used to control the visual appearance such as colors, fonts, layout,and spacing of the content created with HTML. I became familiar with important tags like <div>,<h1> through <h>, and <a>, as well as CSS properties like color, margin, padding, and font-size.

  I also discovered that external and internal stylesheets offer different ways to organize CSS, which is crucial for keeping code clean and scalable. Even though I'm still wrapping my head around how it all fits together, I now have a solid starting point to build from.

blockers: |
    No blockers, just still trying to understand how everything works.

reflection: |
  Today, I spent time watching educational videos on HTML and CSS to build my foundational understanding of web development. Although the concepts are still a bit challenging, I found it helpful to take thorough notes and pause frequently to absorb the material. I realized that learning to code requires both patience and consistent practice, especially when it comes to understanding how different tags and styles interact. The structure of HTML and thee styling power of CSS are becoming clearer, but I know it will take hands-on application to fully grasp them. Overall, today reminded me that progress in learning something new often starts slowly, but sticking with it will pay off.

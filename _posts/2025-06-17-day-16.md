what_i_learned: |
  Today, I learned about the diverse regions of Africa and the many countries within  the continent. Before the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade, African societies had rich cultures with unique foods, music styles, and traditional clothing. They practiced various religions and spoke many languages and dialects that  reflected their Identities.

  Celebrations and festivals were deeply tied to community values, traditions, and the passing down of knowledge. Education was often oral and experiential, passed through storytelling, elders, and communal learning.

reflection: |
  Learning about Africa before the slave trade helped me see the continent in a fuller, more respectful way. It challenged the single-story narrative often shown in history books. I now appreciate the deep cultural roots and accomplishments of African societies long before colonization. Their traditions in food, music, religion, and learning show a world full of creativity, structure, and pride. This understanding gives me a better foundation for honoring the past and seeing Africa's legacy in today's world.

what_i_learned: |
    Today, we spent the morning in a writing workshop that,unfortunately, wasn't as helpful or engaging as we hoped,it felt long-winded and didn't offer much new insight. However, after returning to the lab, I continued working on research for the African Diaspora Media Hub and stayed focused on contributing useful content. Our group also had a productive discussion about tomorrow's upcoming meeting, which helped us align our goals and prepare our talking points. Even with a slow start, I was able to make progress on the project. The day reminded me that not all sessions are impactful, but the work still moves forward.

    No Blockers.

reflection: |
    While the writing workshop didn't meet expectations, I'm learning to take what I can from every experience, even if it's just patience. I appreciated getting back to the lab and returning to meaningful work with my team. Our conversation about tomorrow's meeting gave us a sense of direction and reminded me how focused and committed we are. Days like this test energy, but I'm proud of our ability to regroup and stay productive. We're building something important, even on the off days.
